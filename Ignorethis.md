The GeoPose Conceptual and Logical Model that this new specification (called [we need to give it a name/title]) will always be backward compatible with the GeoPose Standard 1.0 however, it will diverge in the following ways: 
The submitting organizations, participants and acknowledgements may be different (these will be specified at the very end). 
In contrast with GeoPose Standard 1.0, which includes both the CM and JSON encoding, the new specification will have a new/different Conformance clause (Clause 2). Differences include:
Modularity clause will state that there are 2X (precise number TBD) GeoPose Components, and eight standardization targets.
The new specification does not describe or include any conformance tests for any encoding. 
The first statement in clause 2.2 will be expanded (to include all the current statements) to state that the standard defines 2X GeoPose Components. The remainder of clause 2.2 will remain the same.
Clause 2.3 will be renamed from Standardization Targets to “GeoPose Components and Standardization Targets”. All text in the current clause 2.3 will be kept the same and appear after (following) the description of the 2X GeoPose Components.
In contrast with GeoPose Standard 1.0, which describes Standardized Data Units (SDUs) and Standardization Targets, the new specification states that SDUs are now called “GeoPose Components.” The scope clause of the standard will state that the GeoPose Components defined in the new specification includes all the GeoPose 1.0 SDUs as well as new ones:

The Normative References clause (Clause 3) of the new specification will not include any documents (references) to JSON standards or references.
The Terms and Definitions clause (Clause 4) will retain all the current terms and definitions, however, new ones may be added at a later stage.
In contrast with GeoPose Standard 1.0, which describes five categories of use cases, the new specification in addition to the original five, describes the Visual Positioning Service (VPS) use case [found where?]. All the image element components are required to implement the VPS use case.
In the informative clause describing the Logical Model (Clause 7), it will say that the GeoPose Components specified in the present standard for the Logical Model can be encoded in any language and that the conformance tests are described in other specifications to be published by the GeoPose SWG.
Clause 8 will be entirely changed to focus on changing any instance of “SDU” or Structural Data Unit to “GeoPose Components.” All the new GeoPose Components will be added/specified in this clause.
Annex B will be rewritten. 
Annex C about Unix Time will be edited to reflect the updated specification about time. 
Annex E will have the revision history table “clean” (without 1.0 version revisions)
Bibliography may be changed.
