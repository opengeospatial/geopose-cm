## Session timeline

- **User prompt:** "We are returning to this document editing project that we were working on November 21. We provided extensive context for our project. Please go and retrieve that now." 
  - **Assistant actions:** Searched repository for prior context mentions; read `refactoringplan.md`, `README.adoc`, `standard/README.md`, and `standard/clause_8_sdu.adoc` to surface existing project context. Reported project goals, retained scope, SDU overview, branch expectations, and JSON encoding separation.
  - **Assistant response:** Summarized recovered project context from files; noted no stored November 21 conversation present in repo; offered to pull more clause text if needed.

- **User prompt:** "We will need a record (a stored file) that captures everything we are doing when we are working in this repository. This log file in .md format needs to be have the date (yyyy-mm-dd) generated in the title and saved in refactoring-resources directory, under a new subfolder \"logs\" and be detailed with all of the prompts and responses. Create the first of these log files now." 
  - **Assistant actions:** Created `refactoring-resources/logs/` directory. Generated this dated Markdown log capturing session prompts and responses.
  - **Assistant response:** Confirmed creation of the log file and recorded actions here.

- **User prompt:** "please include all of these additional details in the log file" 
  - **Assistant actions:** Added metadata (timestamp, branch, current file), command output, and file change details to the log.
  - **Assistant response:** Confirmed log enrichment and asked about further backfill needs.

- **User prompt:** "yes, please backfill a log for all earlier dates" 
  - **Assistant actions:** Created backfilled log `refactoring-resources/logs/2025-11-21.md` noting absence of transcripts and that details can be added if available.
  - **Assistant response:** Confirmed creation of the backfilled log and offered to flesh out with details if provided.

- **User prompt:** "The PDF contains many images. You will need to interpret the images and the text to understand fully the details of the SDUs. The PDF all the details about the SDUs is in the refactoring-resources directory." 
  - **Assistant actions:** Located `refactoring-resources/GeoPose 1.1 slides.pptx.pdf`; installed `PyPDF2`; extracted text from all 12 pages (images not machine-readable in text extract). Noted component counts by category and descriptions of uncertainty visuals from slides.
  - **Assistant response:** Pending: summarize SDU-related insights from extracted text; acknowledged that images are present and only partially represented in text extraction.

- **User prompt:** "export each slide as an image for closer inspection" 
  - **Assistant actions:** Created `refactoring-resources/slide-images/`; installed `PyMuPDF`; rendered all 12 PDF pages to PNG images (`slide-01.png` … `slide-12.png`) at ~144 dpi.
  - **Assistant response:** Confirmed exports ready for visual review.
