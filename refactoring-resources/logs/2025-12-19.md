## Metadata
- Timestamp captured (UTC): 2025-12-19T08:40:02Z
- Repository branch: `copilot-experiment`
- Logging convention: daily file named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` under `refactoring-resources/logs/` capturing prompts and responses

## Session timeline

### User prompt
"Hello! Go to the refactoring plan and the previous logs contained in the refactoring resources folder to get all the context you will need for this project. We're working today on rewriting the text of all the clauses in the standard folder, especially any files that begin with the word 'clause.' We want to end up with no mentions of Structural Data Units or SDUs and where those are mentioned and used in the current text, we want the references to be to 'components.' For any changes made on this project, please keep track of them in a new file that you will generate and store in the refactoring resources, as part of today's log file."

### Assistant actions
1. Read the refactoring plan (`refactoringplan.md`)
2. Read previous logs (`2025-11-21.md` and `2025-12-12.md`) to understand project context
3. Searched for all clause files in standard folder
4. Searched for all occurrences of "SDU" and "Structural Data Unit" across clause files
5. Created task list to organize the refactoring work
6. Systematically replaced all instances of "Structural Data Units" and "SDUs" with "components" across all relevant files

## Summary

Successfully replaced all references to "Structural Data Units" and "SDUs" with "components" throughout the standard documentation. The changes affected:
- 8 clause files (clause_0 through clause_8)
- 2 annex files (annex-b and annex-ats)
- A total of 10 files modified
- Approximately 60+ individual replacements made

All terminology is now consistent with the new component-based approach. Image file paths in clause_8_sdu.adoc were intentionally preserved to maintain proper image references.
