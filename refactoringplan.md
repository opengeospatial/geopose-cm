Here are instructions to co-pilot for refactoring the content of this repository. 

The current content of the present repository is mostly the same as the GeoPose 1.0 original standard https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-056r11/21-056r11.html

Most content pertaining to JSON Encoding and conformance testing has been removed from this repository. 

In order to make OGC standards more easily used, a goal for future standards is to reduce complexity for implementors by opening the complete conceptual model into the smallest meaningful and resuable units. Once atomic components are defined in a standard, they may be referenced elsewhere in other standards, or in implementations. The standard defines how components are tested for conformance.

 purpose of this project is to build a new GeoPose specification about the GeoPose Conceptual and Logical Model in a GitHub repository that is already set up with Metanorma for publishing as an official OGC document.

Below is intial context:

 

The new specification will retain many parts of the original GeoPose 1.0 Data Exchange Standard. Specifically, new specification will have the same as GeoPose 1.0:
License Agreement 
Keywords (maybe add some?)
Preface
Security Considerations
Conventions (Clause 5) 
Use cases (Clause 6.4)
Logical Model (Clause 7) except where mentioned below.
Annex D will remain a glossary.
